TO DO:

* create project backlog (from what i quickly looked up on it, it seems effectively like a to-do list. outlines the vision for the CW and what were gonna to)
* Project builds to self-contained JAR with Maven (think this is effectively slotting in the code into the project like we did in the first practical; copying and pasting the code)
* Dockerfile for project set-up and works - getting the plugins and downloaded and adding them to the project (this is shown at the end of practical 1)
* GitHub Actions for project set-up and build is working using JAR, and Docker on GitHub Actions - **unsure**
* Correct branches for GitFlow workflow created - includes master, develop, and release branches - seems relitavely okay, think it just consists of making branches on the github website on the repository
* First release created on GitHub - when we finish all the work that has to be done for code review 1, we commit and push it onto the git
* Code of Conduct defined - unsure what this is but i think its either one we have to make or the apache 2.0 licence
* Issues being used on GitHub - **unsure**
* Tasks defined as user stories - think its just creating personas and stuff like that. we done that stuff a while back in first year projects
* Full use cases defined - similar situation to one above
* Use case diagram created - **unsure**
